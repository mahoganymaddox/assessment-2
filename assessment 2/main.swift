//1. Create a program that asks the user to input their first name and last name. Store their input as a variable and then print the input back to the user.
var userInput = readLine()!
print("what is your first name?")
print("what is your last name?")
//2. Create a variable called number
var number = 75
for i in 0...75 {
print(75)
//   we want to check if the variable number is between 1 and 100. Using if and else if statments. If a number is lower than one print "too low" to the console. If a number is higher than 100 print "too high" to the console. If a number is between 1 and 100 then print "It's right". Feel free to change the value of number to test your solution.
//3. Using a for loop create a program that asks the user for 5 numbers then add those numbers together and return it to the users.
/*  Example: "Input number 1"
 2
 "Input number 2"
 2
 "Input number 3"
 2
 "Input number 4"
 2
 "Input number 5"
 2
 "Your total was 10!"
     */
    var number = Int()
    for i in 0...100 {
        print(i)
    }
    if number {
        print("it's right")
    }
    else if < 1{
        print("too low")
    }
    else if > 1 {
        print("too high")
    }
            
        }
    

//4. Give a brief explantion on how the different types of loops work (for, while, repeat)
//for loops set a statement until proven false. while evaluates its condition at the start of each pass through the loop. repeat loops perform a single pass through.
//5. BONUS: Change this code so that it uses ternary rather than an if statement.
var boolInt = true
    trueOrFalse == true ? print("it's true") : print("it's false")
    print("Congratulations! You got the bonus question!") : print("sorry you did not pass the bonus question.")
